# Medical Image Classification

**Objective:** Classify medical images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

**Dataset:** Sample images in `data/`. (Use public dataset for full version)

**Methods:**
- CNN architecture: 4 convolutional layers + 2 fully connected layers
- Data augmentation: rotations, flips, normalization
- Evaluation: Accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report

**Usage:** Run `notebooks/medical_image_classification.ipynb` to see preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
