# ML Projects by Hamed Ehtemali

This repository contains multiple machine learning projects developed during my M.Sc., focusing on NLP, computer vision, and reinforcement learning. 

## Key Projects
1. **Persian Text Sentiment Analysis:** BERT-based NLP pipeline for text classification.
2. **Medical Image Classification:** CNN models for accurate detection of medical images.
3. **E-learning Recommendation System:** Deep learning-based collaborative filtering for personalized content.
4. **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** RL model for resource optimization in smart environments.

These projects demonstrate proficiency in Python, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. Each project folder contains detailed documentation, code, and notebooks.
