# Reinforcement Learning Agent

**Objective:** Optimize resource allocation in a simulated environment using Reinforcement Learning.

**Environment:** Custom Gym environment (`notebooks/env.ipynb`).

**Methods:**
- Algorithm: Q-learning / DQN
- State representation: resource levels and demand
- Action: allocation decisions
- Reward: efficiency score

**Usage:** Run `notebooks/rl_agent.ipynb` to train and evaluate the agent.
