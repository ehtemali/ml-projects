# Reinforcement Learning Agent

**Objective:**  
Optimize resource allocation in a simulated environment using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The agent learns to make efficient allocation decisions to maximize cumulative reward.

**Environment:**  
Custom simulated environment defined in the notebook `notebooks/reinforcement_learning_agent.ipynb`.  
- States: resource levels in the system  
- Actions: allocation decisions (consume or replenish)  
- Rewards: efficiency score based on resource management  

**Methods:**  
- Algorithm: Q-learning (can be extended to DQN)  
- State representation: current resource level  
- Action space: discrete actions controlling resources  
- Reward function: encourages maintaining optimal resource levels  

**Usage:**  
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
